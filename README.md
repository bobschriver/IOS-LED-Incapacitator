An attempt to make an [LED Incapacitator][led] out of a networked group of phones using the camera flash. Single phones should be able to take advantage of the [Bucha Effect][bucha]. The app allows users to change the frequency and duration of their flash blinking.  

Thanks to Nick Vellios for his [iStrobe][istrobe] code.
